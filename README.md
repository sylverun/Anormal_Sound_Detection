# Anormal_Sound_Detection
Bootcamp formation project.

This work shows some bias that new learners can have for their first project. 
No work on optimisation of the models have been performed(no learning rate exploration or other hyperparameters optimisation)
I have been more focus to find good representation of my datas (the deepest layers of my network) than call into question the validation method(mse without other validation).

The dataset used for this work can be found here: https://dcase.community/challenge2022/task-unsupervised-anomalous-sound-detection-for-machine-condition-monitoring
